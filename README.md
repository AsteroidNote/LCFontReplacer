## How to Install

### Step 1
To Install this plugin, you will need to use Thunderstore or r2modman.
If you don't have the BepInEx mod installed in your profile, make sure to install it first.
Once installed, launch the game once, this will create all the folders inside of BepInEx's files.

### Step 2
After launching the game, go back to Thunderstore/r2modman and go to Settings.

## (Optional)

### If you want to put this Plugin into the game without using Thunderstore, it's possible! :D
All you need to do is copy everything from your Thunderstore profile and drag it into the game's files (where your vanilla game is installed).
